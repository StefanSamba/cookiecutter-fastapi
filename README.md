# Cookiecutter API Templating

Article: [TBD]()

## Description

As we're building more and more APIs it's important to:

1. Make this a fast and smooth process
2. Align structure over all APIs

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Pre-requisites

1. Install cookiecutter

```bash
pip3 install cookiecutter
```

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you'd like to create your API.

2. Generate API

```bash
cookiecutter /Users/stefan.samba/Documents/GitHub/cookiecutter
```

3. Enter details in CLI
   The CLI will ask for a project name and endpoint name. Only letters and underscores are allowed here.

For example:
project name: sample_project
endpoint name: analyze_text

Done, your project is ready for use. See readme in your project for more details on how to run it.
